	</div>
	<div class="bd">
    Sometimes you can't pinpoint exactly where an event occurred.  
    Use the accuracy field to let readers know how good the position is.  Some examples are:   
    <ul>
      <li><b>Region</b> somewhere in central Greece </li>
      <li><b>City</b> somewhere in New York</li>
      <li><b>Neighborhood</b> somewhere in the Bronx neighborhood of New York City</li>
      <li><b>Address</b> at 200 Fifth Avenue - use Address</li>
      <li><b>Pinpoint</b> in this room in the palace</li>
      <li><b>Pinpoint</b> on this hill near that rock</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
