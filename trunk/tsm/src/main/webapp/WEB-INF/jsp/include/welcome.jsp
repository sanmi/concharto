		  It is both a searchable map, and a collaborative database of
		events. It gives you simple and elegant answers to hard questions like <em>"What
		interesting things happened near where I am driving? What happened near our
		hotel in Paris? What is happening near my town and surrounding areas? What
		was New York City like from 1858 to 1869?"</em>

		<h2>Beta Testers</h2>
		<p>
			Thank you for participating in the very early stages of this project.  Our goal is to create an
			encyclopedic database of <em>everything that ever happened anywhere</em> by using the power of mass collaboration.  
			At present, the system is fairly basic - it allows you to create and edit events using a  
			unique combination of wiki and mapping capabilities.  Please <a class="links" href="mailto:betatest@timespacemap.com">let us know</a> what you think.  
		</p>
		<p>
			There are now ${totalEvents} events in the database. You can help to create a better 
			<span class="timefont">time</span><span class="spacefont">space</span><span class="mapfont">map</span> by:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adding historical or current events</li>
			<li>Reporting problems</li>
			<li>Suggesting improvements</li>
			<li>Requesting features</li>
			<li>Tell your friends - ask them to be beta testers</li>
		</ul>
		<p>	
			During the beta program we will be rolling out lots of new features and what we build will 
			depend on the feedback we get from you.  Some of the possibilities include: 
		</p>	
		<ul>
			<li>Thumbnail pictures for events</li>
			<li>Arrows on lines</li>
			<li>Improved look and feel</li>
			<li>Advanced search</li>
			<li>Advanced polygon editing</li>
			<li>Change notifications </li>
			<li>Embed a <span class="timefont">time</span><span class="spacefont">space</span><span class="mapfont">map</span> in your page (e.g. a blog or facebook account)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Type something into the search bar and see what happens!
