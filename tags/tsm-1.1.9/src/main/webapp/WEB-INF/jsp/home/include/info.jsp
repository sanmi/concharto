<h2>A Geographic Wiki</h2>
<p> Concharto is a cross between Wikipedia and Google Maps.  Unlike many mapping sites on the internet today, Concharto is not about places - it is about events. 
Unlike Wikipedia, it is about small discrete bits of information, rather than comprehensive articles. 
Like Wikipedia, there is a complete history of changes to events. Anyone can add or edit information. </p>

<h2>Some Guidelines</h2>
<p>Wikipedia has shown how to harness the energy and intelligence of large groups of people in order to 
improve human knowledge. Because the aim of Concharto is similar, we don't have to re-invent all 
of the innovations of Wikipedia. Instead, we emulate them and follow their policies and guidelines 
where possible. The most important of the Guidelines are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neutral Point of View</li>
<li>Verifiability</li>
<li>No original research</li>
</ul>
See our <a href="http://wiki.concharto.com/wiki/Guidelines">guidelines page</a> for more details.
