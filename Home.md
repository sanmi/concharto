# Introduction #

This wiki is for contributors to the concharto project.  For now, there isn't much here.  At present, the entire build and deployment environment is tailored to supporting the concharto website, so we don't have a deployable binary download or even much guidance about how to build and deploy the application.

If you want to try out the code, your best bet is to download the source and read the information in the README.txt file.  If you aren't a java software developer,  you will probably run into problems. In the future, I hope to make it easier to build and deploy.
